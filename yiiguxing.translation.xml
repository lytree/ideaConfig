      <item value="Accepts a {@code @Nullable T} and returns a plain {@code T}, without performing any check that that conversion is safe. &lt;p&gt;This method is intended to help with usages of type parameters that have {@linkplain ParametricNullness parametric nullness}. If a type parameter instead ranges over only non-null types (or if the type is a non-variable type, like {@code String}), then code should almost never use this method, preferring instead to call {@code requireNonNull} so as to benefit from its runtime check. &lt;p&gt;An example use case for this method is in implementing an {@code Iterator&lt;T&gt;} whose {@code next} field is lazily initialized. The type of that field would be {@code @Nullable T}, and the code would be responsible for populating a &quot;real&quot; {@code T} (which might still be the value {@code null}!) before returning it to callers. Depending on how the code is structured, a nullness analysis might not understand that the field has been populated. To avoid that problem without having to add {@code @SuppressWarnings}, the code can call this method. &lt;p&gt;Why &lt;i&gt;not&lt;i&gt; just add {@code SuppressWarnings}? The problem is that this method is typically useful for {@code return} statements. That leaves the code with two options: Either add the suppression to the whole method (which turns off checking for a large section of code), or extract a variable, and put the suppression on that. However, a local variable typically doesn't work: Because nullness analyses typically infer the nullness of local variables, there's no way to assign a {@code @Nullable T} to a field {@code T foo;} and instruct the analysis that that means &quot;plain {@code T}&quot; rather than the inferred type {@code @Nullable T}. (Even if supported added {@code @NonNull}, that would not help, since the problem case addressed by this method is the case in which {@code T} has parametric nullness -- and thus its value may be legitimately {@code null}.)" />
